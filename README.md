# Welcome to My University Python Projects!
#Hello and thank you for visiting my collection of Python projects that I developed during my time at university. These projects showcase my skills in various aspects of software development, including object-oriented programming, system design, testing, and problem-solving.

#Project Overview
Each project in this repository represents a unique challenge and learning experience:

#Four-in-a-Row Game: An implementation of the classic game demonstrating OOP, testing, and problem-solving.
#Grocery Store Simulation: A complex event-driven simulation to optimize checkout processes in a grocery store setting.
#Blocky Game: A graphical game built using Python that explores tree structures, recursion, and GUI interactions.
Due to copyright and security reasons, the source code for these projects is not publicly available directly on GitHub.

#Contact for Source Code
If you need access to the source code for review purposes, please feel free to contact me directly. You can reach me at zixuan.li@mail.com.

#Thank you for your interest, and I hope you find these projects insightful!
